Whether you‚Äôre looking for a cozy apartment, a luxurious villa, or a unique experience, HostHaven connects hosts and travelers in a seamless and secure environment.
- [IPL Score Prediction](https://github.com/imshivang007/IPL-Score-Prediction-) -This project uses deep learning techniques to predict IPL match scores based on historical data and real-time match conditions. By analyzing factors like venue, teams, players, and match performance, the model provides accurate score predictions, enhancing cricket analytics.
- [WeatherWise](https://github.com/imshivang007/WeatherWise.git) - This application provides real-time weather information, allowing you to easily see current weather conditions, forecasts, and more for your desired locations.
